<h1> Maddie's portfolio: </h1>
        
<p> 
    This website is to display maddie's projects from sewing 18th century ball gowns
    to making clothes for their friends that have been requested. Maddie moved to Brixham
    in 2024, kind of, they were being NomadMaddie living in their van; Winston.
    Eventually Maddie landed in Brixham and loved it soooo much that they decided to stay.
    Quite quickly they became part of the community and began a sewing course to make a ball
    gown for Brixham's Pirate Festival and it went from that to making clothes in a spur of the moment thing.
